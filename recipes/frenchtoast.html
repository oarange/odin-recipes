    <h2> <strong> Description </strong></h2>
    <p>Brioche and challah bread make the best French toast. Both are already so eggy that once dipped in the batter and griddled in butter they become custard-like on the inside. </p>
    <p>  The nicely browned and caramelized outside is thanks in part to the added sugar in the egg mixture. And playing with the flavor is easy: This recipe has a touch of warmth from cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons sugar </li>
        <li> 4 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li> 4 eggs </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup milk </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 8 slices challah, brioche, or white bread </li>
    <h2> Directions </h2>
    <p> In a small bowl, combine cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar and set aside briefly.</p>
    <p> In a 10-inch or 12-inch skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk together cinnamon mixture, eggs, milk, and vanilla and pour into a shallow container such as a pie plate. Dip bread in egg mixture. Fry slices until golden brown, then flip to cook the other side. Serve with syrup.
